My [Pebble watch](https://getpebble.com/) arrived today. Here are my initial thoughts having worn and used it for the last 6 hours.

* My main reason for buying a watch was for telling the time (and because I can't rely on having my phone on/with me at music festivals). The fact that the Pebble does other stuff is a bonus.
* This is the first watch I've ever worn and having something permanently attached to my wrist feels very alien to me.
* I wish I could remove some of the default watch faces and just keep the "text watch" face; if you hit either the top or bottom buttons on the right-hand side accidentally the watch face changes and I don't like the look of them.
* I don't know whether or not to call it a watch or a Pebble when referring to it.
* At first I was wearing the ~~Pebble~~ watch on my dominant (right) hand and I was finding it a bit awkward to use. I've since moved it to my left hand and found it much more comfortable to press the buttons, although I seemingly have to turn my wrist more towards in order to look at the time.
* I think the buttons are too resistant to being pushed and flipping through the menus can be a bit awkward.
* I wear a long overcoat when out and about and it annoys me having to get my iPhone out of my pocket to look at the time or change the song that is playing. I can now leave my phone in my pocket and tell the time and change the music all at the push of a button on my wrist. It's the little things in life...
* I love having iOS notifications pushed to my wrist however I keep accidentally pushing the middle button on the right-hand side and dismissing them all before I've read them; I wish there was a way to view past notifications.
* I now want more contextual information available immediately to me on my wrist - e.g. if I'm within a few metres of a bus stop, I want it to tell me which buses are coming next and when? I'm going to take a look at the [Pebble SDK](https://developer.getpebble.com/) to see if I could perhaps make an app to do this.
* There doesn't seem to be a way of telling how drained the battery is which is strange.

I'll report back in a week or so with some updates.
