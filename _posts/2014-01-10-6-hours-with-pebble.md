My [Pebble watch](https://getpebble.com/) arrived today and here are my initial thoughts having worn and used it for the last 6 hours.

* This is the first watch I've ever worn, having something on my wrist feels very alien to me.
* I wish I could remove the default watch faces and just keep the "text watch" face, if you hit either the top or bottom buttons on the right-hand-side accidentally the watch face changes and I don't like the look of them.
* I don't know whether or not to call it a watch or a Pebble when referring to it.
* At first I was wearing the ~~Pebble~~ watch on my dominant (right) hand and I was finding it a bit awkward to use. I've since moved it to my left and found it much more comfortable to press the buttons, although I seemingly have to turn my wrist more in order to look at the time.
* I think the buttons are too resistant to being pushed and flipping through the menus can be a bit awkward.
* I wear a long overcoat and it annoyed me having to get my iPhone out of my pocket to look at the time or change the song I'm playing, I can now leave my phone in my pocket and tell the time and change my music. It's the little things in life...
* I love having iOS notifications pushed to my wrist however I keep accidentally pushing the middle button on the right0hand-side and dismissing them all before I've read them; I wish there was a way to view past notifications.
* I now want more contextual information immediately available to me on my wrist - e.g. if I'm within a few metres of a bus stop, which buses are coming next and when? I'm going to take a look at the [SDK](https://developer.getpebble.com/) to see if I could perhaps make this.
* I'm looking forward to seeing what version 2.0 of the firmware will bring along with the Pebble appstore.
* There doesn't seem to be a way of telling how drained the battery is which is strange.

I'll report back in a week or so with some updates.
