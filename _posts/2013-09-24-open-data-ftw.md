Joseph Braybrook, an intern at the [Ordanance Survey Inovation Labs](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/innovate/), [has created 86,000 square miles worth of geographically accurate Great Britain](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/innovate/developers/minecraft-map-britain.html) using some of their [open data products](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/opendata-products.html).

Some fine work there. In the linked blog post you can download the Minecraft world too.
