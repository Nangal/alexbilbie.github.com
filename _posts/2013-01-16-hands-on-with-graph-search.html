<p>
	The Verge, who are quickly becoming my favourite technology news website, have got a hands-on video with the new Facebook Graph Search.

	It looks pretty cool but I can't imagine myself wanting to search the web from inside Facebook, especially as about a centimetre on my screen above this new universal search bar there is Chrome's own universal search bar (which I have searching <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a>).

	It would be great if Facebook open sourced the natural language parser that they've designed - I can think of loads of applications where I would want to use it, plus when combined with the new <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html">Web Speech API</a> support that has just <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/hello-browser.html">landed in Chrome 25</a> I've got dreams of having my own Tony Stark-esque Jarvis system.
