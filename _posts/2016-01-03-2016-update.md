It's been a very long time since I've posted here; 2015 turned out to be an insanely busy year.

[SnapCam](http://snapc.am/), the app I've been involved with since late 2014 launched in June. Working on SnapCam has been great fun; I've gotten to work on some really interesting problems and learnt a lot about the world of printing and app development. I've also had the opportunity to build some cool <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> tech with Raspberry PIs and learn an arcane printer programming language (ZPL).

My day job has pretty much taken up all of my time over the past year which in many ways has been incredible for learning and I'm incredibly fortunate to be in a position to have worked on a platform to support an app used by an audience many times larger than I've ever had before. 

This year I'm setting some resolutions to try and ensure that I achieve some of the things I've wanted to do for a while:

* Blog more; 2015 featured just 3 posts compared to over sixty in 2013.
* Start a podcast
* Release v5 of [league/oauth2-server](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server)
* Release [my OAuth book](https://leanpub.com/oauthello-a-book-about-oauth/)
* Regularly attend some London tech meetups
* Submit a talk and speak at at least one major conference this year
* Read at least 20 books; half of which will be fiction
* Release an open source project in another language aside from PHP

I've also spent a bit of time today tidying up this blog and adding links in the sidebar to groups of posts that are popular (such as my [OAuth articles](/tag/oauth)).
