I'm very excited to say that my talk proposal entitled "AAPI Driven Development: Eating Your Own Dog Food" has been accepted for [PHPNE Conference 2013](http://conference.phpne.org.uk/) on the 19th of March 2013 in Newcastle Upon Tyne.

At the time of writing there 44 tickets still available [so go get one](https://phpne13.eventbrite.co.uk/).

I can't wait :D
