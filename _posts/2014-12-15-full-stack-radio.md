Last week I was invited by [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) to appear on his Full Stack Radio podcast. We talked in depth about the OAuth 2 specification including all of the major grant types (when is best to use them, and some of the pitfalls), and then we talked about API security strategies for one of Adam's side projects. It was good geeky fun.
