When I moved to London a friend recommended that I start using the buses more than the Tube or the trains because I'll better learn how the different areas and boroughs join up. And they were right, my knowledge of how (South) London interlinks now extends to both above ground as well as on the underground below. I've even saved myself some money by getting a weekly bus travelcard instead of a monthly zone 3-5 travelcard.

Even so, I'll admit I've struggled though with the bus system; around my nearest tube station there are no less than 14 different bus stops serving 18 different routes. At each bus stop there is a sign which lists the bus routes it serves as well as the final destination of the route and some of the larger landmarks or roads they pass along.

All of this is easy enough if I'm going to one of the final destinations but what I struggle with is knowing which bus to get if I'm not going that far or even if the bus route goes anywhere near where I actually want to go to - for example I might want to go to Streatham and I know I need the Brixton bus but I don't necessarily know if the bus goes through Streatham or skirts around the edge of it.

None of the bus routes at the bus stop have a map of their routes and every iPhone app I've used will visualise the route on a map but won't let me drop a pin on the map simultaneously so I can see if the route goes anywhere near where I actually want to be. Similarly discovery sucks, I might be at a bus stop (or even have several bus stops around me) but I can't visualise at all where all the possible places I could potentially go [within one bus journey].

Even worse is getting the bus home, I often find myself in the evenings in an unfamiliar part of London having been to see a play or a gig or something and I'm left wondering how on earth I'm going to get home (especially when the Northern Line is completely suspended as it is this weekend). Again I might have several different bus stops around me in this unknown area of London but do any of them actually serve a bus route that is of any use to me to get home or should I walk further down the road, and if so, in which direction?

There are quite a few iPhone apps available as well as [TFL's own website](http://tfl.gov.uk) (talking of which, their [beta website](http://beta.tfl.gov.uk) is bloody lovely) and my quest to find the perfect app that solves my needs as listed above has so far cost me about Â£20 in terms of apps purchased on the App Store. The best that I've found so far is Citymapper but there are still lots of things that I don't like about it.

So anyway, for the past few weeks I've been trying to learn how to make iOS apps (more on this in another blog post) and I've talked to friends and colleagues about my ideas for this app and have received some positive feedback which has spurred me on. Some others though have questioned why I'm bothering when there are so many apps already available and I have a number of answers:

1. The existing apps don't fulfill my needs.
2. I'm a geek and it's in my nature to spend tens of hours solving a problem that will later go on to save me just a few minutes.
3. I really do believe I've got some unique solutions to the problem.
4. The entire thing will be built on [open data](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/businessandpartners/syndication/default.aspx) and that makes me happy.

Anyway those who've questioned why I'm attempting this have planted some seeds of doubt in my mind and I'll admit I have been questioning why myself, but this evening I watched [Marco Arment's excellent talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2RoYvcqhgM) from XOXO conference where he's talking about entering a crowed market with his new iOS podcasting app and why he is bothering and it's rekindled my desire to crack on and make this app.

I've embedded the video below and I thoroughly recommend you watch it.
