The Prime Minister's speech at the London Conference on Cyberspace back in 2011. Note the last paragraph:

> "Government doesn’t own the internet, or run the internet, or shape the internet. So together, I hope we can set an agenda for the future. Thank you."

Hopefully we'll hear of a policy abandonment during PMQs this week following the significant backlash since the original announcment.
