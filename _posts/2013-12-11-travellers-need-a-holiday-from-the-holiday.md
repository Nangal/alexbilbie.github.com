> Sometimes, travellers need a holiday from the holiday. A chance to recharge, to stay in one place for a while, establish a little bit of a routine and just enjoy the art of not doing.

My good friend Tara who has been travelling around the world for the last 6 months, through Africa, India and Asia. She's still got another two continents to go!

She's written some fantastic posts throughout her trip, do check out her blog.
