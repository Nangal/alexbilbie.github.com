<p>I&#8217;ve very pleased to announce that <a href="http://lncd.org">LNCD</a> have won another JISC funded project under the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/aim.aspx">Access and Identity Management programme</a>. This will be the fifth JISC project I&#8217;ll have worked on (for the other projects I&#8217;ve been involved with see <a href="/about">my bio</a>.</p>

<p>The project is called Linkey (yes we managed to make another Lincoln based pun to join our others - <a href="http://lncn.eu">lncn.eu</a> (&#8220;Linking You&#8221;) and <a href="http://lncd.org">LNCD</a> (&#8220;LNCD <em>is</em> Not <em>a</em> Central Development <em>group</em>&#8221;) and will be looking at how the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2">OAuth 2.0 specification</a> can be implemented in HEIs. The primary driver for this is to improve the student and staff experience and meet the following objectives:</p>

<ol>
<li>Richer sharing of data between applications: A student or lecturer should be able to identify themselves to multiple applications and approve access to the sharing of personal data between those applications.</li>
<li>A consistent user experience (UX): We are initially aiming for ‘consistent sign on’ rather than &#8216;single sign on&#8217;, where the user is presented with a consistent UX when signing into disparate applications.</li>
<li>Rapid deployment: New applications that we develop or purchase should be easier to implement, plugging into either OAuth or the UAG and immediately benefiting from 1) and 2).</li>
</ol>

<p>The project will last for 12 months and the primary outcomes will be:</p>

<ol>
<li>A case study about our use and implementation of OAuth here at the <a href="http://lincoln.ac.uk">University of Lincoln</a></li>
<li>Significantly adding to my <a href="https://github.com/alexbilbie/CodeIgniter-OAuth-2.0-Server">CodeIgniter OAuth 2.0 server</a> by implementing the OAuth SAML bearer specification as well as hopefully all of the main authentication flows. I&#8217;m also going to work with on turning it it into a generic PHP Composer package so any PHP application can get some OAuth love. Finally I want to look at implementing [Selenium] tests (in addition to the usual PHPUnit tests) so that there is an awesome user experience.</li>
<li>A public workshop on the use of OAuth 2.0 in Further and Higher Education.</li>
<li>A conference/journal paper, based on our case study.</li>
</ol>
