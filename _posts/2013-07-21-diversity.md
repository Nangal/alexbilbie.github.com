A beautiful post by Eran Hammer.

> In a rich, multidimensional reality, we must consider not only the attributes of the individuals, but also the makeup of the community we are trying to build. Setting a goal of more women, blacks, gays, etc. is pointless. Thatâ€™s a stupid goal. Setting quotas is mechanical and more likely alienate others instead of bringing them in.
