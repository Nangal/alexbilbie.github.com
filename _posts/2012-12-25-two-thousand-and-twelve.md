On reflection 2012 seems to have gone immensely quickly. Here are some of my highlights:

In February I helped organise the annual [DevCSI](http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/) [Dev8D](http://dev8d.org) conference and ended up doing my [HTML5 talk three](https://speakerdeck.com/alexbilbie/introduction-to-html5-and-css3) times due to popular demand. I also helped organise and [spoke about MongoDB](https://speakerdeck.com/alexbilbie/introduction-to-mongodb) at the annual UK leg of the CodeIgniter.

In May I saw the end of my degree (finally!) and I spoke (and helped out at) DevCSI's new conference, [Dev8ed](http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/past-events/dev8ed/).

In June I visited to my friend in Berlin and spent a few days exploring the city.

I July I started my new research project, [Linkey](http://linkey.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk) which is looking at the use of OAuth in higher education institutions and how it can be made to work in a corporate environment run on proprietary software.

In August I spent a few days away in the rolling hills of Shropshire with friends which was wonderfully relaxing, appropriately boozy and we ate like kings. I also moved into my first ever flat by myself.

In September, for the first time in 18 years I didn't have to return to studying.

In early November I visited the USA for the first time with Dave Tarrant from the University of Southampton to take part in the international Scholarly Infrastructure Technical Summit (S.I.T.S) meeting. We also spent a few days up in the Colorado mountains at David Flanders' parents lodge 8500ft above sea level. Amazing.

Finally just this month I was accepted to talk at the [PHP North East conference](http://conference.phpne.org.uk/) next March about API driven development.

Looking forward to 2013, I'm hoping to do some more travelling; both America and Scandanavia are on the table. I'm planning on starting my own company with my friend Nick; more on that soon. I can't wait.
