It's common knowledge amongst my friends that my popular culture knowledge really sucks. I've never really been one to watch TV, I generally discover bands several months after everyone else does and my housemates have carved head shaped holes behind the sofas where they've banged their heads after I've admitted not watching yet another "but everyone has seen it" film.

I recently counted how many of the [IMDB top 100 films](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top) I've seen and it's a pitiful 18:

* (8) [The Dark Knight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/)
* (9) [The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/)
* (11) [Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/)
* (15) [The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/)
* (17) [Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/)
* (20) [The Matrix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/)
* (23) [Raiders of the Lost Ark](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/)
* (26) [Se7en](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/)
* (27) [The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/)
* (40) [Saving Private Ryan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/)
* (52) [Amelie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/)
* (56) [WALLÂ·E](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/)
* (59) [A Clockwork Orange](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/)
* (77) [Gladiator](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/)
* (80) [Monty Python and the Holy Grail](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/)
* (89) [Braveheart](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112573/)
* (94) [Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/)
* (95) [Pan's Labyrinth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/)

I've obviously seen more than 18 films in my life - I quickly scanned over the next 150 "top" films and I can see at least another 20 that I've seen - but to have only seen 18 out of the top 100 films of all time is, I'm regularly told, a sorry state of affairs.

Therefore I've decided it's time to do something about it. From next week onwards, for as long as it takes, I'm going to try and watch one or two of the IMDB top 100 files (in order) a week starting with the number one ranked film, [The Shawshank Redemption](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/).

I will write a small review of each film after I've watched it on this blog as a record of my "achievements".
