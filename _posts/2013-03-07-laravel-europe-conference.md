I'm a few days late with posting this but if you live in Europe and you're a fan of the Laravel framework then [you should definately fill this form out](https://heybigname.typeform.com/to/oXujNm) to let the guys in America know that we'd love an official Laracon over here.

They're currently proposing to run the conference in Amsterdam in late summer.
