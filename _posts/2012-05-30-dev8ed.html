	I’ve just got back from two days at <a href="http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/upcoming-events/dev8ed/">Dev8ed</a> which was hosted at Conference Aston. This was my 6th or 7th <a href="http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/">DevCSI</a> event as as with all the others it was very well organised at we were looked after throughout the event.
</p>

<p>
	On day one I spent the morning discussing some of the potential use cases of <a href="http://xcri.org/">XCRI-CAP</a> feeds, which, for those who don’t know are XML dumps published by educational institutions to describe the courses they offer.
</p>

<p>
	My favourite potential use case of the course data is a tool that will allow prospective students to download a personalised prospectus. The main problem with most institution prospectuses currently are that they contain every single course that is available. What would be nice is a way for a prospective student to express keywords or the types of course they are interested in and then they will be able to download a PDF prospectus that was generated on the fly that only includes courses that are relevant to them.
</p>

<p>
	On day two I did two presentations. The first presentation was about the different tools and services we use in <a href="http://lncd.org/">LNCD</a> which help us be better developers.

<p>
	The second presentation was an introduction to HTML5 and CSS3 (based on my presentation I did at Dev8D).
