When I relaunched this blog I intended to not just talk about technology and code but also some other interests of mine.

> “And now for something completely different...”

This evening I downloaded the new iPad app from luxury online retailer [Mr Porter](http://mrporter.com) entitled [The Tux](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mr-porter-the-tux/id575880306?mt=8) (warning: 1.4GB download). The app is elegantly put together and features micro video interviews with fashion aficionados, cocktail making lessons with top New York barmen and guides on how to wear a tuxedo in a traditional manner and how to add a modern twist.

Having read through the app I’ve finally made the decision that in the new year I’m going to invest some money in buying a new tuxedo. I bought my current tuxedo about 18 months ago from the UK high street retailer Next as the jacket was the only one that I found (within my budget) with a shawl collar and a comfortable slim fitting cut. This suit is actually my second tuxedo, my first being one I bought reasonably cheaply in a sale from ASOS back in 2009.

I actually get a surprising amount of wear from my current tuxedo as I can count about 8 occasions in the last 12 months which have required black tie attire. The suit was definitely worth the money that I paid, both in terms of the upfront cost and the minor adjustments I had to it at the tailors.

So what do I want from a new tuxedo? Anyone who knows me personally is aware that I have a ridiculously large amount of clothes and they wouldn’t be surprised to hear that I’ve already put a fair bit of thought into this.

First of all I’m fairly pale skinned with dirty-blonde hair and I think that I should avoid a black suit going forward. Midnight to navy blue is the obvious choice as I’ve yet to see anyone pull off a burgundy or grey tuxedo well.

Second I do like shawl collars. Fewer men wear shawl collar jackets, opting for peak or notch lapels and I like to have something a bit different. I love Tom Ford’s oversized lapels on his suits, especially the grosgrain shawl lapels on his AW12 mens collection.

Next I want a new dress shirt. I like dress shirts that have a ribbed bib, I already have a nice one from the Jil Sander x Uniqlo collection, but I’ve always wanted one with cufflinks. I also don’t like black buttons, preferring hidden or white buttons.

Finally, I’d like to experiment with some accessories, and I’m inspired by items such as [this buttonhole](http://www.mrporter.com/product/197786) by Lanvin and [these gorgeous slippers](http://www.mrporter.com/product/312516) by Jimmy Choo or these [loafers by ASOS](http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Velvet-Tassel-Loafers-With-Leather-Sole/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2174212).

Whilst I certainly can’t afford (at the moment...he says longingly) a Tom Ford or Burberry tuxedo I will hopefully come across something in the new year that I can invest in, either from a high end high street retailer or a boutique vintage shop.

Whilst digging around for inspiration for this post I came across this fantastic quote which I’ve heard before but didn’t know who said it:

> What is it about wearing a tuxedo or that little black dress, that makes us feel confident, beautiful, splendid, even invincible?
>
> We put on formal wear and suddenly we become extraordinary.
>
> On the days when you feel low and invisible, why not try this on for size: imagine you are wearing a fantastic tailored tuxedo or a stunning formal gown.
>
> And then proceed with your day.
