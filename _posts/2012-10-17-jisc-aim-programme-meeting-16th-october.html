	Yesterday I travelled to Birmingham for a JISC AIM programme meeting at the beautiful Aston University campus.
</p>

<p>
	I presented a short talk about the Linkey project. My slides are embedded below. Note, I don't really like very "wordy" presentation slides so I keep them simple, however you should be able to get the gist of the talk :)
