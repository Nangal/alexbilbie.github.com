I'm very honoured to have been invited to join the [CodeIgniter](https://github.com/ellislab/codeigniter) project as a core contributor (known as a [reactor engineer](http://codeigniter.com/news/codeigniter_in_2011_reactor_core_uservoice/)).

I'm looking forward to getting stuck in fixing bugs, helping the community out and promoting the use of CodeIgniter.

I owe many thanks to Ellislab and Phil Sturgeon for their support.
