Taylor Otwell, the creator of the Laravel framework, has announced a new Laravel project - Laravel Passport - which uses my [`league/oauth2-server`](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server) project to "build an OAuth 2.0 backed API server in five minutes".

This will be the second [League of Extraordinary Packages](http://thephpleague.com) project that has native Laravel support; the first being the amazing [Flysystem](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com) by Frank de Jonge which power's [Laravel's Filesystem APIs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/filesystem).

I will hopefully have a tutorial available shortly demonstrating how to use Passport once I've got my hands on the code.
