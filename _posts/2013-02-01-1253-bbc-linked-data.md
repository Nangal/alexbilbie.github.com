A fascinating blog post on the BBC Internet Blog about how they're using semantic [linked data](http://linkeddata.org/) as a fundamental part of their data architecture. There is [another great article here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2010/07/the_world_cup_and_a_call_to_ac.html) which talks about their first experiments with linked data for the 2010 World Cup.

It's a shame we so rarely ever get to play with their experiments though. Having said that there are a few of their older projects avaiable on the [R&D Labs page](http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/labs).
