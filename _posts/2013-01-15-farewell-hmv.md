>  "I am proud to be leaving HMV with a profitable future secured. The appointment of Trevor Moore means that I will be leaving the company in safe hands."

> _- Simon Fox, former chief executive of HMV_

Today it was announced the UK highstreet retailer HMV was going into administration. Simon Fox also said "[Trevor Moore] has the right skills and experience to lead HMV in the coming years".

Trevor Moore used to be the chief executive of Jessops (which went into administration last week), and a senior executive at Threshers and Coffee Republic (both of which went into administration in 2009).

If I worked for a company that was considering bringing Moore onto their board of execs I'd be pretty scared.
