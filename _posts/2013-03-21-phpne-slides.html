<p>On Tuesday I presented at the first ever <a href="http://conference.phpne.org.uk/">PHP North East</a> conference in Newcastle. Hosted in the fantastic <a href="https://www.tynesidecinema.co.uk/">Tyneside Cinema</a> (which is the last surviving Newsreel theatre still operating as a cinema full-time in the UK), it was a very well organised event and I’m incredibly grateful to the <a href="http://phpne.org.uk/">PHP North East group</a> for accepting my talk proposal.</p>

<p>My topic was “API driven development: Eating your own dog food”, I’ve embedded my slides below:</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="570f6a2072c90130970822000a9f0177" data-ratio="1.22634730538922" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

<p>Unfortunately they weren’t able to talk so my slides may seem a little out of context but hopefully you can get the overall gist of what I talked about.</p>

<p>Once again, I’d like to say thank you to Anthony Sterling and the PHPNE crew for putting on a wonderful event.</p>
