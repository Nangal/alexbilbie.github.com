I still remember watching the 1997 Special Edition releases at the cinema with my Dad and then dressing up as a jedi to go and see The Phantom Menace with my friends when I was 9.

Having recently watched Star Wars in the "machete order" I agree with much of this article and I think it'll be the way I introduce my kids to Star Wars one day.

It's worth mentioning that I also really enjoyed the 2008 Star Wars Clone Wars film and the CGI TV series; the most recent season was very political (and violent) and for a "kids" show I found myself looking forward to waiting for the next episode each week. That and the animation was some of the best I've ever seen.
