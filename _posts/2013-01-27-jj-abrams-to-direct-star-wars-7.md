I'm very excited about this - I love Abrams' previous work on Fringe, Alias, Star Trek and Cloverfield.

Having said this whole Disney/LucasFilm/Bad Robot relationship thing is a bit unnerving. I really hope they don't do anything stupid and start mixing universes and come out with something like "Episode VII: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue".

"Episode VII: Pirates of Dagobah" might be cool though.
