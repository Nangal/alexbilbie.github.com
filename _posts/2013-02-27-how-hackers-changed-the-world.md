Last night I watched a BBC Four [Storyville](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mfx6) documentary called ["How hackers changed the world: We Are Legion"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qxmwp).

The programmes blurb is:

> A documentary going inside the complex network and history of Anonymous, the radical online 'hacktivist' collective, using interviews with members, writers and academics.

If you're interested in the history of hacking culture, how computers are changing the world, and how anyone with an Internet can easily make their voice heard by the masses then I'd recommend giving it a watch.

At the time of writing there are still 5 days of availability on iPlayer (it's available until 10:29PM on Monday 4th March).
