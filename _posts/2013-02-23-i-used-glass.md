title: "I used Google Glass: the future, with monthly updates"

> But I walked away convinced that this wasn’t just one of Google’s weird flights of fancy. The more I used Glass the more it made sense to me; the more I wanted it. If the team had told me I could sign up to have my current glasses augmented with Glass technology, I would have put pen to paper (and money in their hands) right then and there. And it’s that kind of stuff that will make the difference between this being a niche device for geeks and a product that everyone wants to experience.

Great article by Joshua Topolsky for The Verge. Google are hoping to have it in the shops by the end of 2013. If developers can add their own features to Glass then I think this will be amazing.
