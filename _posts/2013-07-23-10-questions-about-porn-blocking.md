title: "10 questions about Cameron's porn-blocking plan"

I've mostly been a supporter of the current coalition government we have here in the UK but the Prime Minister's plan to block porn websites by default for all UK household broadband connections has made me angry and concerned. [This blog post](http://paulbernal.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/10-questions-about-camerons-new-porn-blocking/) by Paul Bernal lists many of the same questions that I've been thinking about since the plan was announced yesterday, namely:

1. Who will decide what counts as ‘pornography’, and how?
2. What else do you want to censor further down the line?
3. What happens when people ‘opt-in’ and who knows that I've opted in?

I for one will certainly opt-in, not because I'm an avid porn fan but because I pay good money for my Internet connection, there aren't any children in my household (not that I would enable a filter if there were) and finally I am perfectly capable of deciding for myself what I deem appropriate.

In 2007 the Cleanfeed system was rolled out by BT to filter out child pornography identified by the Internet Watch Foundation and CEOP and over the next few years almost every other ISP in the UK implemented a variant of it. I think it is completely appropriate that child porn is blocked but because of the nature of how the blacklist of websites is managed it is hard for us citizens to ensure that only what is appropriate to block is blocked. Back in 2008 the Wikipedia page for Virgin Killer by The Scorpions [was blocked](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/07/brit_isps_censor_wikipedia/) despite the image being widly available elsewhere (especially on ecommerce websites). Fortunately after public outcry the website was unblocked but it makes you wonder what else has disappeared as well that has yet to be noticed as missing.

Also of note is that it is the same Cleanfeed filtering system (which is intended to block child pornography) that has been used to block NewzBin 2 and the Pirate Bay by most of the big ISPs here. Talk about mission creep.

Even when the blacklist is taken out of the hands of the public sector and overseen by an Internet giant things can go wrong - in 2009 someone at Google accidentally put a wildcard in their malware blacklist and [classified the entire world wide web as containing malware](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/31/google_malware_snafu/).

I have yet to see any research that suggests blocking pornography by default will "stop the corrosion of childhood" and until I do I stand firmly against these plans. I firmly believe that it is up to parents, carers and those with responsibility for children to decide what is appropriate content.
