I'm sat writing this as I watch the One Show which is the final ever live broadcast from BBC Television Centre.

I've been fortunate to visit Television Centre twice, once just a fortnight ago today, and also back in July 2011. My close friend Josh was working there both times I visited and he gave me a full tour of the entire building in 2011. I remember walking round in near silence as I absorbed 50 years of broadcasting history - it really is an incredible building which just oodles culture. I particularly remember visiting the Blue Peter garden and having my photo next to the Tardis. We also stood in the tech gallery and watched as the audience were warmed up for Jool's Hollands show.

Whilst I don't have any more experiences that I do feel truly honoured for having the opportunity to visit somewhere where so many of my favourite TV shows were filmed, from Blue Peter to Black Adder and Fawlty Towers.

Goodbye TVC!
