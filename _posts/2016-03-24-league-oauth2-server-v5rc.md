**league/oauth2-server** [version 5.0.0 release candidate 1](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server/releases/tag/5.0.0-RC1) has just been tagged!

Coming just over a year since the last major release, version 5.0 is a complete code rewrite with significantly simplified interfaces, improved OAuth 2 specification support and JWT support out of the box.

I've rewritten all of the documentation, viewable here - [http://oauth2.thephpleague.com](http://oauth2.thephpleague.com).

I will announce future release candidates and the final release here on my blog and through [The PHP League twitter account](https://twitter.com/thephpleague).

Please feel free to ask questions on the [Github issues page](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server/issues) and propose changes with a pull request.
