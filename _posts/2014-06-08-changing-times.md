For the past year I've been relatively quiet about my day to day work owing to the "stealth" mode we have been operating with the project at [Videogamer](http://videogamer.com). After many a rewrite the initial MVP of the project is complete and I'm very proud of what we have designed, coded and architected. There is still some work to be done on the business side before the project is revealed but I'm really excited for the future of the site and the team.

What I can say is though is that I've had the opportunity to play with some great technologies such as Elasticsearch, Neo4J and Ansible and I truly feel excited to be a developer at the moment. In my spare time I'm playing around with Docker, and I've been teaching myself Ruby and RubyMotion and I've written about 5000 words of [my book](/2014/01/introducing-oauthello/).

At the end of May my contract was up at Videogamer and it was time to move on, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with the team and I wish them all the best for the future; I really do believe the platform we've been building is the foundation of something great and I'm excited to see it in the wild.

Tomorrow I'm joining [Yuza](http://yuza.com), a mobile business incubator in central London as their new software engineer. Yuza have recently launched [Pollen Velocity Capital](http://pollen.vc/), a service which pays developers their app store revenues on a weekly basis (instead of the 30+ days that it can take for Apple and Google to pay); this money can then be one-click reinvested into social media campaigns or paid directly into the developer's bank account.

I've been relatively quiet on the blogging front this year but I intend to get back to regular blogging soon - I've already a post about OpenID 2.0 in my drafts folder, and I've been working on a big update to my OAuth 2.0 Server library.

Until then, adieu.
