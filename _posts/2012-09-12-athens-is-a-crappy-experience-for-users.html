title: Athens is a crappy experience for users

<p>This afternoon I decided to join the <a href="https://community.ja.net/groups/access-and-identity-management-aim">JANET Access and Identity Management group</a>.</p>

<p>I hit the join group button on the site and was then prompted to join the JANET community. Seeing that it supported UK Access Management Federation (UK AMF) sign in, I entered my university&#8217;s name and clicked continue.</p>

<p>I was then forwarded to a login screen on the OpenAthens site. I don&#8217;t think I have any OpenAthens credentials so I clicked &#8220;Alternative login&#8221; (but first I accidentally clicked &#8220;Forgotten password?&#8221; thanks to my haste and the tiny links).</p>

<p>Then I had to choose my institution (again???).</p>

<p>Then I was asked to click on a link to take me to my institution&#8217;s login page.</p>

<p>Then I was forwarded onto our current Athens sign-in endpoint where I authenticated with my University of Lincoln network credentials.</p>

<p>Finally I was returned to the JANET Community sign-up screen only to see that none of the form fields had been pre-filled because of course the UK AMF is anonymised.</p>

<p>What a waste of time and a terrible user experience.</p>
