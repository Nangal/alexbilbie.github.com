I was recently invited to join [Phil Sturgeon](http://philsturgeon.co.uk), [Ben Edmunds](http://benedmunds.com/) and [Zachary Blank](https://twitter.com/zachianblank) on the [PHP Town Hall] podcast to talk about OAuth 2.0.

Check it out - [http://phptownhall.com//blog/2013/07/10/episode-9-is-oauth-2-the-devil/](http://phptownhall.com//blog/2013/07/10/episode-9-is-oauth-2-the-devil/).

Please forgive my waffling, it was midnight GMT by the time we started recording and I was high as a kite on Red Bull and jelly beans.
